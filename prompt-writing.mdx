# Prompt Writing

Prompt Wrangler uses [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/), a popular templating language, to construct prompts dynamically. This guide will walk you through how to construct and manipulate prompts using Handlebars and the special features provided by Prompt Wrangler.

## Accessing Arguments

You can access arguments within your prompt using the following syntax:

```
{{{ args.ARG_NAME }}}
```

Replace `ARG_NAME` with the name of the argument you wish to access.

<Note>
We recommend using `{{{ }}}` instead of `{{ }}`, as the former does not escape output, which is useful since we're not dealing with HTML here.
</Note>

## Special Variables

There are a couple of special system variables you can use:

- `{{{ system.today }}}`: Inserts the current date
- `{{{ system.now }}}`: Inserts the current date and time

## Handlebars Features

You can utilize all the features of Handlebars, including conditional logic. For example:

```handlebars
{{#if args.condition}}
  This will display if args.condition is truthy.
{{else}}
  This will display if args.condition is falsy.
{{/if}}
```

## Helpers

### Limit Strings

Prompt Wrangler also includes a `limit` helper that allows you to limit the number of tokens in a text string. This can be useful for constraining the length of your output text.

The `limit` helper takes two parameters: the text to limit, and the maximum number of tokens. Please note that the number of tokens is an approximation.

Here's how to use the `limit` helper:

```handlebars
{{{limit args.test 100}}}
```

In this example, `args.test` is the text string you want to limit, and `100` is the maximum number of tokens. If `args.test` contains more than 100 tokens, only the first 100 will be displayed.

Note: Tokens in this context are not necessarily single words; they can also be punctuation, special characters, or other meaningful units of text as determined by the underlying system.

### JSON Formatting

Prompt Wrangler provides several built-in helpers to format JSON arguments:

- `table`: formats the JSON as a markdown table
- `json`: formats the JSON as a JSON string
- `yaml`: formats the JSON as a YAML string

For the `table` helper, you can use the `c` option to order and filter the columns. The `c` option takes a comma-separated list of column names.

#### Examples:

Here's an example that uses the `table` helper:

```handlebars
{{{table args.json c="id,animal"}}}
```

Here's an example that uses the `json` helper:

```handlebars
{{{json args.json}}}
```

Here's an example that uses the `yaml` helper:

```handlebars
{{{yaml args.json}}}
```

By using these helpers and Handlebars syntax, you can create dynamic, powerful prompts for your application.

### Combining Helpers

Helpers can be combined together uses parentheses and a nested syntax. For example if you want to convert to yaml but only include the first 20 tokens you could do the following:

```handlebars
{{{limit (yaml args.json) 20}}}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### 1. What is the Handlebars syntax used for in Prompt Wrangler?

Handlebars is a popular templating language that Prompt Wrangler uses for constructing dynamic prompts. It provides various features like accessing arguments, conditional logic, and using built-in helpers for formatting.

#### 2. How do I access arguments in my prompt?

You can access arguments in your prompt using the `{{{ args.ARG_NAME }}}` syntax. Replace `ARG_NAME` with the actual name of the argument you want to access.

#### 3. Why should I use `{{{ }}}` instead of `{{ }}` in Prompt Wrangler?

We recommend using `{{{ }}}` because it does not escape output. This is useful since we're not dealing with HTML in Prompt Wrangler.

#### 4. How do I use the special system variables?

There are two special system variables that you can use in Prompt Wrangler. `{{{ system.today }}}` inserts the current date, and `{{{ system.now }}}` inserts the current date and time.

#### 5. Can I use conditional logic in Handlebars?

Yes, Handlebars supports conditional logic. For example:

```handlebars
{{#if args.condition}}
  This will display if args.condition is truthy.
{{else}}
  This will display if args.condition is falsy.
{{/if}}
```

#### 6. How do I format JSON arguments in Prompt Wrangler?

You can use the built-in helpers `table`, `json`, and `yaml` to format JSON arguments. You can also order and filter columns in the table helper using the `c` option.

#### 7. How do I limit the number of tokens in a text string?

You can use the `limit` helper to restrict the number of tokens in a text string. For example, `{{{ limit args.test 100 }}}` will limit the text string `args.test` to approximately 100 tokens.

#### 8. What is a token in the context of the `limit` helper?

The limit helper uses an approximation of 2.5 characters per token. This is a conservative estimate that should work for most use cases.
