When running a prompt you pass in a series of arguments. These arguments are passed in as a JSON object. Each prompt has a specific argument schema that these arguments need to conform to. In order to configure your arg schema you should click the gear icon the prompt editor.

If you want to pass in arbitrary json use the `json` option and Prompt Wrangler will automatically format as json. This is good for free-form unstructured data.

If your arguments don't conform to the schema you will get an error message.
