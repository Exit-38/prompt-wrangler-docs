To authenticate via the API you should pass in an API key via the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
'x-api-key': '<API_KEY>'
```

## API Keys

To create an API Key go into the Prompt Wrangler interface, click on API Keys and then create a new one.

## Public Prompts

If you are trying to use a prompt that is public you can alternaltiy pass in a `x-openai-api-key` instead of an `x-api-key` header. This will allow you to use the API without an account for `public` prompts.

```bash
'x-openai-api-key': '<OPENAI_API_KEY>'
```
